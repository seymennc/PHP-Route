# PHP Route Library

The PHP Route Library allows you to define HTTP-based routes quickly and flexibly. It is designed especially for use in MVC structures. It offers advanced features like flexible route definitions, middleware integration, and named routes.

## Features
- **HTTP Method Support:** Supports HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.
- **Route Grouping:** Group similar routes to create a more organized and cleaner structure.
- **Prefix Support:** Add a prefix to all routes to create dynamic and organized route structures.
- **Middleware:** Define middleware for each route to control requests before or after processing.
- **Named Routes:** Name your routes to simplify dynamic URL generation.
- **Dynamic Route Patterns:** Build flexible structures with route parameters.
