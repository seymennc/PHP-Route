- **Route Grouping:** Group similar routes to create a more organized and cleaner structure.
- **Prefix Support:** Add a prefix to all routes to create dynamic and organized route structures.
- **Middleware:** Define middleware for each route to control requests before or after processing.
- **Named Routes:** Name your routes to simplify dynamic URL generation.
- **Dynamic Route Patterns:** Build flexible structures with route parameters.

## Installation

To use the project, follow these steps:

### Git Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seymennc/php-route.git
```
```bash
cd php-route
```
```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Composer
#### If you create new project with php-router
```bash
composer create-project seymennc/php-route php-route
```
```php
cd php-route
```
```php
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### If you will only use it in your project
```php
composer require seymennc/php-route
```


## Usage

Include the autoloader in your project:
```bash
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
Then, include the web.php file in your project:
```bash
require __DIR__ . '/web/web.php';
```
Finally, add dispatch the routes:
```php
Route::dispatch();
```

### Basic Usage
You can define your routes in the web.php file.

This method defines a route that responds to GET requests to the /home URL. The function returns the string 'Home Page' when the route is accessed.
#### Basic GET Route
```php
use Luminance\Service\phproute\Route\Route;

Route::method('get')->route('/home', function() {
    return 'Home Page';
})->name('home');
```
###
#### Basic POST Route

In addition to the home URL, let's add a new route that responds to POST requests. When the route is accessed, the function returns the string 'Post Page'.
```php
Route::method('post')->route('/home', function() {
    return 'Home Post Page';
})->name('home');
```

###
#### With Controller
You can also define routes that respond to requests with a controller. In this example, the route responds to GET requests to the /about URL. When the route is accessed, the AboutController class's index method is called.
```php
Route::method('get')->route('/home', 'AboutController@index')->name('about');
```

###
#### With Middleware
You can define middleware for each route. In this example, the route responds to GET requests to the /contact URL. When the route is accessed, the function returns the string 'Contact Page'. The middleware function is called before the route is processed.
```php
Route::method('get')->route('/contact', function() {
    return 'Contact Page';
})->middleware('auth')->name('contact');
```
###
#### Route Grouping and Prefix
You can group similar routes to create a more organized and cleaner structure. In this example, the routes are grouped under the /admin prefix. The routes respond to GET requests to the /admin/dashboard and /admin/profile URLs.
```php
Route::prefix('/admin')->group(function() {
    Route::method('get')->route('/dashboard', 'AdminController@index');
    Route::method('post')->route('/profile', 'AdminController@profile');
});
```
